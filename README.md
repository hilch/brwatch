# INA
brwatch requires **INA** protocol enabled. 
Currently **ANSL** is not supported.

# PVI
brwatch needs [PVI](https://www.br-automation.com/en/downloads/#categories=Software/Automation+NET%2FPVI) to run.
Beware: if you do not own a PVI license **1TG0500.02** PVI will run for two hours only. After this period one must restart it.
So do not blame brwatch for it :-)
